SELECT business_id, user_id FROM reviews r JOIN businesses b ON r.business_id = b.id JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id;
Which returned:
1|3

3|1
Which represents our relevant data.


-To view the userâ€™s name, business name, star rating and the comment we entered: 
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses, users, reviews;
