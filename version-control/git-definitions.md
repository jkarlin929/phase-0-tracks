# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a system that records changes to a given file or files over time. It is useful because you can see who made changes and when, in order to fix for bugs.
    
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is an independent line of development, one would use it when working on a team, each completed different tasks.
    -
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is a save point for git. A good commit message is short but informative of changes made.
    -
* What is a merge conflict?
    - Merge conflict occurs when pulling branches and the content doesn't operate with the file. Merging is the act of integrating another branch into your current working branch.
