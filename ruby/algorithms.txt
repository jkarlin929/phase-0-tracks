Robot Elevator Algorithm:
You are on the ground floor and need to get the 34th floor of the 35 floor building.
    On the ground floor, the Elevator is given two options up or down:
        -Press the up button to go up
        -Press the down button to go down
    When the doors open:
        -Check to see if elevator is going up or down
    If elevator is going up:
        -Press button 34  
        -Wait until the elevator displays floor 34
    If elevator is going down:
        -remain still
    If other passengers are present when entering elevator:
        -Wait until floor is equal to 34
        -Get out of elevator
    In case of fire:
        -Use stairs (sorry about the 34 flights, Robot)
